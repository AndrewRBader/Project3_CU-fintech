We ran into a problem with fractionalizing the erc721 tokens to erc20 tokens. The contract functions properly in remix and then everything works in web3.py but we are not able to use functions on the second erc20 token. After research this problem is within ganache since our contract works as expected in remix and it only breaks when it is used through ganache local blockchain. For this reason, we have left the functionality inside the solidity file for fractionalizing the nft because if this project went to production we would be able to incorporate this functionality. For now it is left out of the final product.
